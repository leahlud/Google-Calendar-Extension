# Calendar Colors+

[In progress] Currently, Google Calendar limits users to having one custom color per calendar, meaning if you want to color all of your different events with unique colors, you need to create many calendars to do so. This Google Chrome extension offers an alternative way to style your calendar how you want. Use this extension to choose your own unique color palette and assign them to your events!
